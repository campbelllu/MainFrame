<h1>Why'd We Make This Site?</h1>
<p>Learning about personal finance led to learning about saving for retirement, which led to different investing strategies.
    </br>Obviously, this included individual stocks and their financial statements, and down the rabbit hole we went.
    </br>Eventually, having some experience in IT, we wanted to make tools that would streamline our company research processes.
    </br>Some sites do some things better than our tools, but this is our attempt to consolidate what we look for in one place.
    </br>Given enough time and iterations, it can only get better from here.
</p>

<h1>How does it all work?</h1>
<p>The SEC has made all company filings public record, available both online and through an API, EDGAR.
    </br>Using those previously mentioned IT skills, we 'spoke' with EDGAR and gathered the stats we were looking to analyze 
        for every company on record.
    </br>The data cleaning process backfills missing values so that growth rates can be approximated where filing records aren't 
        available. Some missing values are chosen via statistical averaging methods, some are left blank, some made zero, judged 
        appropriately for context. This is why we emphasize the disclaimer at the bottom of each page: These records here ARE taken 
        from legally reported values, scrutinized heavily by the SEC, however, some values simply weren't available for various reasons.
    </br>Other approximations are also made to determine average values across different time frames and in different contexts. 
        Hence, the final numbers you see may be 100% accurate, or they may be whazzy-whoozy silly things that need revision. 
    </br>So while we use these tools to help our stock analysis, we highly encourage everyone who visits here to verify the numbers 
        you see here on other sites, through the SEC's records directly, on the company's websites themselves, or with a licensed financial 
        adviser. Everything on this site is for educational purposes only: Please see our disclaimer below.

<h1>what</h1>
<h1>What Are Future Plans for this Site?</h1>
<p>We get this data for free. Or... 'free enough', considering internet, hosting, and power bills. And the hair loss related to trying to read EDGAR responses and learning new IT skills. 
    </br>But basically for free, directly from the SEC.
    </br>So because we get the data for free at this time, we're attracted to the idea of democratizing it, and how we've organized it, making it free to the people.
    </br>We've flirted with different monetization and business plans for the site, but ultimately think it's best to leave it available for all. 
    </br>Your suggestions for more tools for us to build, feedback on user experience and interface improvements, and other general (friendly) suggestions are highly encouraged via 
        <a href="{% url 'contact' %}" id="contactp">Our Contact Page</a>.

    </br>If you feel so inclined and find yourself in a place to do so, your willingness to help support this site goes a long way to keeping the site running and means the world to us.

<h1>shout out</h1>
<p>
    This site is a work in progress, made solely with HTML+CSS sitting on top of a Django backend.
    </br>Logins and authentication will eventually be added to gain access to different paid services, 
    but until that time no user data will ever be logged, shared, or otherwise involved with the use of, 
    or the visiting of, this site.
