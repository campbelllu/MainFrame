<h1>Funny Enough...</h1>
<p>
    This project started as a homelab project to learn DevOps skills. 
</p>
<p>
    With a grasp on Docker, Terraform, AWS, CI/CD, we realized the next few steps involved deploying actual software. We could have grabbed something generic, made a hello world app, something, 
    </br>but instead decided to start churning out something related to our current favorite hobby: Securities analysis.
</p>
<p>
    Bouncing between multiple websites, trying to piece together the data we wanted, we thought, "Why not just build what we're looking for?" 
    </br>So many months later, it's back to the DevOps side of things, getting ready to deploy version 0.0.1 of this thing.
</p>

<h1>Tech Stack</h1>
<p>
    <strong>Python 3.10.12</strong>: Data cleaning done with Pandas library, coffee, sweat, tears, ecstatic joy each week as new learning hurdles were overcome
    </br><strong>Django 4.2.1</strong>, with the expected gunicorn and NGINX setup
    </br><strong>SQLite</strong> internal DB for now, chosen for simplicity and lack of user I/O, authentication, quick prototyping. Migration to PostgreSQL later if authentication is needed might be considered.
    </br><a href="https://www.sec.gov/search-filings/edgar-application-programming-interfaces" id="contactp">SEC's EDGAR API to source all data</a> via requests library
    </br><strong>Github Actions</strong> to full CI/CD at this time. Simple, familiar choice. May drop the CD part for another tool, learned recently that Ansible can actually be incorporated 
            in this process which may prove helpful given we're deploying to...
    </br><strong>AWS Lightsail</strong> for hosting. Cheap hosting option until migration due to scaling reasons becomes necessary. 
    </br>Unsure at this point how new Lightsail instances and Terraform interact, how much 
            maintenance is required for routing of new instances, setting them up to our <strong>NGINX</strong> proxy and with Route53, essentially, can we use Lightsail like we would EC2's, as cattle? 
            Or are they a more static infrastructure piece and the headache wouldn't be worth the time? We'll see.
    </br>Vanilla HTML and CSS is the only 'secret sauce' running the front end at this point.

</p>

<h1>Flaws, Learning Opportunities, Vulnerabilities, Site-Self-Reflection</h1>
    <p>
        The admin page is completely disabled. A version of the Django secret key is in earlier repo versions, making Django Forms a security compromised Python tool. However, there is no sensitive data in the database 
            and data tampering is nearly impossible. Even if the data were able to be accessed nefariously, we have backups, no sensitive data is present, and for much less of a hacking headache the data therein 
            is already much more easily accessible via the EDGAR API link above. The juice is most definitely not worth the squeeze unless Django has a bug bounty out, in which case you're legally required to split the 
            cash prize with us, the victim. :-p
    </p>
    <p>
        If future versions of the website require login authentication, or the storing of any sensitive data like names, addresses, payment info, user passwords, anything at all, a complete overhaul of this app's 
        security would be necessary. Django secret keys would be stored in a secrets vault, or in a .env file to be deployed and 'installed' as environment variables, properly securing the whole thing.
    </p>
    <p>
        The UI consists solely of Django Templating: HTML + CSS + unholy amounts of time for our data analysts and backend engineers to figure out how frontend stuff works.
    </p>
    <p>
        Future versions of the site, if UI revamp is necessary via increased traffic attention, will include <strong>Django Rest Framework</strong>, and most likely, a proper <strong>React</strong> frontend. 
    </p>

<h1>Friendly Self-Advertisement</h1>
<p>
    Server costs only go up from this point on. As we upgrade the UI, migrate to better architecture as needed, that all increases daily costs on our end.
