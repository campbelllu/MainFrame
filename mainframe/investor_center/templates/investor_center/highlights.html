                What even are 'Stock Highlights'?
        </summary>
        <p>Looking through company 10-Q's and 10'K's gives you a great summary of how a company is doing. The downside? They take forever to go through every detail.
            Solution? Look at a summary of their Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement! Sure! </br>
            Except that also contains a lot of detailed accounting facts that, while very useful, take a lot of time to properly understand and decipher.</br>
            Second solution? Look at Stock Highlights! Each of our reports breaks down the pieces of a company's 10-K report, 
            an annual report each company files with the SEC, giving you what we think are the most important pieces, explained below in detail.</br>
            All highlights are limited to the most recent five years of data, saving full filing records for future subscription service offerings.</br>
            However, all growth rates are based off of the entirety of the filed data, giving you exclusive access to a company's full performance records, even as 
            a free user of the site.

        <summary>What's in the Summary Highlights, and Why?</summary>
        <p>A condensed version of the other five Highlights.
            </br>Less details, more to the point, for quick checks or referencing.
            </br>See the other Highlights, or descriptions on this page, for more details.

        <summary>What's in the Income Statement Highlights, and Why?</summary>
    <p>When going over an Income Statement, there's lots of details, and a few key pieces that sum things up nicely. 
        What you'll see with our highlights are those key pieces that we find the most important. </br>First, you'll find the top-line item, Revenue. 
        This is sales. This is the pile of money the company made in that specific fiscal year. </br>Next, we include 
        bottom-line items, Net Income and Funds from Operations (FFO). After all the bills are paid, what's the company 
        left with? Also known as earnings, profits, or 'The Good Stuff'. Pro-tip: When looking into a REIT, look at the FFO, not Net Income. 
        </br>With our data collection methods, explained below, getting a more accurate REIT-related Net Income of AFFO 
        (Adjusted Funds from Operations) was out of the question, but FFO is a decent proxy and still provides the data 
        necessary to make accurate company analyses. 
        </br>Third, we've included the company's relationship to their outstanding share count. It lets you see if they're 
        diluting your ownership position, or buying back shares. 
        </br>Finally, we include Earnings per Share (EPS) in two forms: Reported and Calculated. Reported EPS values were present 
        in the SEC filings, made by the company directly, but sometimes companies just didn't report values at all. No worries, 
        we did the math for them. Using the company's market capitalization and current share price, we were able to determine 
        a fairly accurate number of shares outstanding, when those too were missing. Whether they included shares outstanding or not, 
        we were then able to divide their earnings by that share count for our Calculated EPS values. You may see some discrepencies 
        when both reported and calculated values are present, but you'll be comforted in noting that the diffrences are slight or 
        non-existent in most cases.
        </br>Where most EPS values are Net Income divided by shares outstanding, we also included a REIT EPS value for any 
        REIT investors looking for this. This is calculated using FFO divided by shares outstanding.
        </br>And obviously, we've also included all of the respective growth rates to give you something meaningful to go along with all those 
        raw dollar amounts.
    </p>

        <summary>
            What's in the Balance Sheet Highlights, and Why?
        </summary>
        <p>When going over a Balance Sheet, there's lots of details and a few key pieces that sum things up nicely. 
            What you'll see with our highlights are those key pieces that we find the most important. 
            </br>First, you'll find Shareholder's Equity, 
            which represents everything the company owns minus everything that it owes. Calculated SE is a value we've constructed from the company's 
            reported Total Assets less their Total Liabilities. Reported SE is the SE that the company has reported to the SEC directly. We've included 
            both for you to compare how different companies have reported their assets and liabilities. 
            </br>Next, we include Book Value, both Reported and Calculated, because it takes that SE and divides it by Shares Outstanding, giving you 
            a frame of reference for how much of that Equity each share is worth. 
            </br>Net Asset Value is synonymous with Book Value, and most firms don't report it to the SEC, leaving most of these columns blank. Some banks 
            and BDC's will report this metric, giving you another frame of reference for BV of the firm.
            </br>The final columns showing Debt metrics give you an idea for how the company is managing debt. Note that debt is included in SE 
            intrinsically, being a single part of their liabilities.
            </br>And obviously, we've also included all of the respective growth rates to give you something meaningful to go along with all those 
            raw dollar amounts.
        </p>

    <details>
        <summary>
            What's in the Cash Flow Statement Highlights, and Why?
        </summary>
        <p>
            Cash Flow Statements consist of a few parts, culminating in one summation that tells how money is flowing through the company.
            </br>Operating Cash Flow deals with company operations, how cash is flowing depending on sales and the costs of keeping the business running.
            </br>Investing Cash Flow deals with the company putting money into future growth, as well as other costs and gains.
            </br>Financing Cash Flow deals with the company dealing with debt and dividends, as well as other costs and gains.
            </br>Net Cash Flow is the summation of those previous three values, telling you if all of the company actions have accrued a net cost or gain 
            to the company cash ledger. It's a pure value representing the movement of cash within the company on an annual basis.
            </br>Next you'll see Capex, the amount of money spent by the company to expand operations, or buy new hardware to expand business.
            </br>Free Cash Flow is Operating Cash Flow minus Capex, showing what cash is available after all business actiivities, costs, and investing back 
            into the company. Many consider this a more pure version of profitability than Net Income.
            </br>Free Cash Flow Margin is FCF / Revenue for any given annual period.
            </br>And obviously, we've also included all of the respective growth rates to give you something meaningful to go along with all those 
            raw dollar amounts.

            What's in the Efficiency Highlights, and Why?
        </summary>
        <p>
            When a company invests in itself, it's making a calculated bet that the funds it invests will help itself to grow.
            </br>ROIC is defined in the legend below. It's a great measure of efficiency of the company and its leadership, used for analyzing companies 
            in the same sector, in the same tax jurisdictions. It uses a series of calculations to determine how the company's investments in itself are paying off, 
            utilizing a calculation of Operating Profit minus tax payments over Assets plus debt minus cash on hand. 
            </br>ROCE is defined in the legend below. It's a great measure of efficiency of the company and its leadership, used for analyzing companies 
            in the same sector, across different tax jurisdictions. It uses a series of calculations to determine how the company's investments in itself are paying off, 
            utilizing a calculation of Net Income over Shareholder Equity.
            </br>We prefer using ROCE for our effiency rankings as it is a more succinct measure of corporate efficiency, and works across all tax domains, so a Consumer Staples 
            company in any country can be compared to a Consumer Staples company in any other country without any messy currency conversions or tax considerations.
            </br>The calculated version we've put together from the constituent values reported to the SEC, while the Reported values are calculated using Reported 
            Shareholder Value where applicable.
            </br>We've included a version of ROCE for REIT's in this highlight section to help REIT investors get an idea of how FFO over Shareholder Equity looks.

            What's in the Dividend Highlights, and Why?
        </summary>
        <p>
            We all want to know what kind of cash flow owning a share of a company will provide us. 
            </br>Total Dividends paid shows how much cash total the company is paying yearly to shareholders. It gives another metric to judge how their dividend 
            payments grow, but is not the industry standard for measuring dividend growth.
            </br>Calculated and Reported Dividends per share are self-explanatory, but in one we used the Total Dividends paid divided by Shares Outstanding, and 
            in the other we're just sharing what the company has reported as having paid to the SEC.
            </br>Payout ratios are displayed using dividends paid over Net Income in first case, Free Cash Flow over NI in the second, and the third is for REIT's, 
            using FFO over NI.

            How do we get these values? Are they accurate? What do blank data cells mean?
        </summary>
    
        <p>All information here has been downloaded using the SEC's EDGAR API, providing direct access to all company 
            filings. Hence, all the information is accurate. However, decoding exactly which values are labeled as... what 
            exactly? That was quite a puzzle while parsing the XBRL/JSON response. We're still deciphering all the different 
            labels as the schema seems to differ between different companies, filing in different standards and nations, 
            but the values you'll find here are accurate to the best of our ability. Which is pretty dang good, if you don't mind 
            us bragging for a moment. If you do find massive discrepencies between what you see here and what you find elsewhere, 
            please don't hesitate to reach out through our 'Contact' page and let us know. We are striving to provide good information 
            here, and any errors you catch will help not just us, but every person who visits this site.

<!-- Currently, some company data seems to have a looping error in which the earliest year had no reported values
