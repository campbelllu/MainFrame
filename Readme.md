To-Do
1. Write a Readme.md
2. Make a requirements.txt file for Dockerization
3. Once container is made, move onto K8's setup
4. Learn K8's... again
5. Debate ansible vs pulumi to add to the stack first
6. Decide to do ansible first so you can integrate jenkins at the same time.
7. realize you'll probably need pulumi first to spin up new containers for jenkins to deploy to.
8. Now go back and make mainframe do more than produce a greeting from General Kenobi.
9. Watch pipeline break when adding retorts from General Grievous.
10. Add monitoring to the pipeline. No idea how Grafana and Prometheus work, yet. Could be helpful here.
11. Monitoring up? Go back to that mainframe editing stuff.
12. Pipeline doesn't break with edits? Enjoy developing personal projects! 
13. Rest easy knowing that it'll all break again when you start practicing deploying on cloud. Figure it out quick to not get charged once trial period ends.
14. Think about Kivy for platform agnostic UI's for your mainframe app's.
15. Debate hiring a React dev for web integrations. Maybe dabble yourself to understand front end better.
16. You've been applying to jobs this whole time, right?
17. Remember to have fun! :)
